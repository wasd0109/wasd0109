### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Ken ([wasd0109](https://github.com/wasd0109))

I am from Hong Kong, currently studying at Tokyo Institute of Technology.
**But I am also a self-taught programmer!**
I am hoping to hone my skills as a programmer during my study!
Follow me on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/tsuguminxken)** and lets talk about programming _or about my **[oshi](https://toyota-team8.jp/member/onoue_mizuki.php)**_ !!

### My Current Plan

- [ ] Arrive at Japan (Yes, I'm stuck at Hong Kong because of you know why)
- [ ] Practice with my programming skills
- [ ] Finish my post-graduate study
- [ ] Become master programmer and cancer biologist!
